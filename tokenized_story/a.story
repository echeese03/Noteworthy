The shaping of north america planet earth took on its present form slowly . Some 225 million years ago , a single supercontinent contained all the world 's dry land . Then enormous chunks of terrain began to drift away from this colossal continent , open ing the atlantic and indian oceans , narrowing the pacific ocean , and forming the great landmasses of eurasia , africa , australia , antarctica , and the americas . The existence of a single original continent has been proved in part by the discovery of nearly identical species of fish that swim today in the long - separated freshwater lakes of the various continents . Continued shifting and folding of the earth 's crust thrust up mountain ranges . The appalachians were probably formed even before continental separation , perhaps 350 million years ago . The majestic ranges of western north america the rockies , the sierra nevada , the cascades , and the coast ranges arose much more recently , geologically speaking , some 135 million to 25 million years ago . They are truly ameri can mountains , born after the continent took on its own separate geological identity . By about 10 million years ago , nature had sculpted the basic geological shape of north america . The conti nent was anchored in its northeastern corner by the massive canadian shield a zone undergirded by anciont rocknrobably the first nart of that became the
